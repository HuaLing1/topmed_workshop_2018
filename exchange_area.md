# Downloading Data From The TOPMed Exchange Area

If you know you have access to your study's TOPMed Exchange Area, you can follow along with these instructions:
https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/system/files/Information/How%20to%20Download%20Data%20from%20the%20dbGaP%20Exchange%20Area.pdf

## What is the TOPMed Exchange Area (EA)?
* Exchange Areas are a special section of dbGaP storage that facilitates collaboration in large multicenter projects.
* The TOPMed EA allows pre-release data (genotypes, phenotypes, *etc.*) to be stored and exchanged between TOPMed investigators.

## How does the EA work?
* There isn't just one TOPMed EA, but **one EA for each TOPMed project study**
* Each project study's **TOPMed accession** has a section of "Provisional files" - this is the EA
    * You'll get more information about dbGaP parent accession vs. child accession vs. TOPMed accession later
* Project studies may upload additional data to the EA, where those with access can download it
* TOPMed genotype freezes are available for TOPMed investigators before general release
* EA data should only be downloaded to appropriately protected computer systems (i.e. **not your personal laptop**)

## What data can I find in the EA?
* IRC's combined sequencing result .vcfs (genotype freezes)
* DCC-harmonized phenotypes
* DCC's sample annotation
    * Corrected sample swaps
    * Unique individuals (excludes duplicates, MZ twins)
    * Inferred sex chromosome karyotype
* DCC's kinship estimates
* DCC's principal components
* Phenotype data shared for specific working groups

## Who can access the TOPMed EA?
1. An "elligible investigator" who has been nominated for access by a TOPMed project study
2. A designated downloader for one of the nominated investigators
* If you are an analyst who needs to work with TOPMed data, you will probably gain access to it through your PI
* See [detailed information](https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/topmed-data-sharing-policies#D) at the TOPMed website

## How can I download data from the EA?
* An elligible investigator must be nominated by their study and complete a Data Access Request (DAR) before accessing the EA data
* See [detailed instructions](https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/system/files/Information/How%20to%20Download%20Data%20from%20the%20dbGaP%20Exchange%20Area.pdf) (with screenshots!) on the TOPMed website

## Quick How-to
1. Log in to the [dbGaP controlled access area](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login)
2. Go to "My Requests" tab
3. Find the TOPMed accession (has "NHLBI TOPMed" in the study name) for a study you're associated with and click on "Request Files"
4. Click on the "Provisional files" tab
5. Select the files you want to download
6. Use the information provided to start an Aspera download of the data
